  caveats <<~EOS
    Pinax is not notarized: it has no Apple Developer ID. macOS blocks the
    first open of every new version. To open it:

      1. Open Pinax once and dismiss the warning.
      2. Open System Settings › Privacy & Security.
      3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Pinax message, then confirm.

    Each new version has a new code signature. The first time it reads a
    backend credential, Keychain asks again; click "Always Allow".
